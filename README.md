# My-Portfolio
This is the start of my portfolio site.  This repository contains an about me page, a contact page, and a portfolio page.  Each page has a navbar with working links.  My name and the about link both lead to the about me page.  Contact and portfolio links lead to their corresponding pages.  There is also a working button link to my linkedin profile on the about me page.
Every page was created using Bootstrap and a few styling elements added into the css file found in the css folder within the assets folder.
They are fully responsive for large to extra-small screen sizes.
